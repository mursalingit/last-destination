<h3>Off the chart musicianship and vocals. 

    • An amazing set list: Eclectic in scope but with a common thread --The Good Stuff that Moves Your Feet! 
    
    • Top shelf stage production (PA/lights) with the best sound tech - so good it's like he's not there.   
    
    • And keeping it all running smoothly and bridging the divide between the crowd and the band is the hardest working man in show business -- Joe Lonsky (aka Joey J or Little joe).
    
    A note about the musicianship: This lineup of musicians has played as side men for a long list of the greats. Chuck Berry, The Temptations, Natalie Cole, Aretha Franklin, Maynard Ferguson, Frank Sinatra Jr., The Spinners, Bobby Vinton, The Miles Davis Orchestra! Heck, the trumpet player, Jeff Stockham, was in the movie, Lincoln, with his Civil War band for three seconds!  These guys have been around 
    and proven themselves. They play with The Destination to prove one more thing: That you can have boatloads of fun while giving 110% 
    to your trade.  </h3>
